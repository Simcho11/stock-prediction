# stock-prediction
This is a repository of a machine learning project I made in Python. It uses an artificial recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). I use LSTM to predict the closing stock price of a corporation (CDW in this case) using the past 60 day stock price.

## Stock Prediction
This Python script closing stock price data from Yahoo for a given company. The script uses Pandas, Pandas DataReader, NumPy, scklearn MinMax Scaler, MatPlotlib, and LSTM to predict closing stock prices. 

**Successes**
- RMSE of ~2.5
- Accurately visualizes the data

**Room for Improvement**
- Had to rely on online resources for this project
- Hope to commit a lot of what I learned to memory

**Takeaways**
- First time working with ML doing data analysis
- Got more practice visualizing data
